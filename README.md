## ‚ö°Ô∏è WatchFav Timeline

I'm being student from mechanical engineering having knowledge of basic DSA and enthusiasm for software development. It has been first ever project for me that is build end-to-end right from scratch. It wasn't possible without consistent & punctual daily routines. It has been one of the best learning experiences I encounter till now where I have learned so many tech stacks and not only learned but implemented as well. 

Here is 4-week consisted timeline what is followed to build this project.

## üí° Challenges faced and learnings

- Had very basic knowledge of React before the Microsoft Engage Program's qualification announcement. Spent about 168hrs learning the new concepts attached to React and then began the design-build process of this project.
- For my love of frontend styling, I took up the challenge of cloning the original Team's UI delicately. Improved my CSS skills vastly by practising them here.
- Never implemented user authentication before. Understood how to register apps on Github and Twitter and make use of their API's for user authentication.
- Got my Twitter application (used for authentication) suspended twice, due to it mistakenly being caught up in automated abusive API disabling spam groups. Had to raise support tickets to get the app re-enabled, despite no API violations from my end.
- Never incorporated a realtime database storage like Firebase to my projects before. Comprehensively read through the cloud firestore documentation and grasped the concepts within a day's time.
- Came across a memory-leak bug while building a socket connection from client side to server side. Couldn't get my doubt resolved even from Stack Overflow. Took me about one week to resolve it by thorough researching of the hints provided by my mentor. Saved my project from getting disqualified because this bug was a barrier in implementing the minimum requirement feature of the Engage'21 Challenge.
- Deployed a full stack app with frontend, backend and database for the first time. Struggled through it but documentations and tutorials came to the rescue as always. 
- Learnt about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and proxies.


<a id="scope"></a>
## üöß Future Scope/ What's next?

- [ ] Adding user authentication.
- [ ] User Dashboard showing users activity
- [ ] Add to favourite button on movies which will add movies in users dashboard
- [ ] Watch Later
- [ ] Collobrate filtering with the different users available on our website
