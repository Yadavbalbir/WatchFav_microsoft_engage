## ‚ö°Ô∏è WatchFav Timeline

I'm being student from mechanical engineering having knowledge of basic DSA and enthusiasm for software development. It has been first ever project for me that is build end-to-end right from scratch. It wasn't possible without consistent & punctual daily routines. It has been one of the best learning experiences I encounter till now where I have learned so many tech stacks and not only learned but implemented as well. 

Here is 4-week consisted timeline what is followed to build this project.
